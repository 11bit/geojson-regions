geojson-regions
===============

A repo to create simplified GeoJSON regions so we can display map-based visualisations without having to load tiles all over the place.

I just threw this one together based on [the Natural Earth data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) which offers public domain shapefiles. My ultimate aim is to split this data into logical regions, add capital cities and country borders. I'd like to eventually use OpenStreetMap metadata syntax too, save reinventing the wheel, but we'll see.
